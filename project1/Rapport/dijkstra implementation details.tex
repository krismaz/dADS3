\section{Dijkstra Implementation Details}

Dijkstra's Algorithm is implemented in a very straightforward way. It is given an array of nodes, and computes the single-source shortest path from the first of these elements.
We chose to represent neighbours in a list structure, instead of a distance matrix, to better accomodate sparse data sets.
