-Port BitSmartvETree to *nix (BitscanForward/Reverse has *nix variants)
-Check that the vEB tree makes sense
-Template the vEB heap to make it support bitsmart
-Make the tree in the heap be new-allocated instead of throwing it on the stack
-Do comparison-counting in vEB trees
-Disable assertions (#NDEBUG)
-Experiments with other heaps
-Experiments with other trees (either from algos in c or std::set)
