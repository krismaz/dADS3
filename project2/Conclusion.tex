\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we have managed to implement Van Emde Boas trees in a way that turned out to give very fast running times.

We saw a much better running time for heaps and search trees when using the Van Emde Boas tree as a backing data structure, and when using a special bit twiddling optimization, we even managed to bring the memory usage down below below that of standard heap or search tree structures when we insert a significant portion of the universe.
