\subsection{Expectations}

In this second test we expect to see similar trends as in the first, with the Van Emde Boas trees being significantly faster than the Red-Black tree. In terms of memory, we expect the normal Van Emde Boas tree to use a very large chunk of memory, but hope that bit magic Van Emde Boas tree will use a constant small amount of memory, hopefully less than the Red-Black tree at large data sizes.
