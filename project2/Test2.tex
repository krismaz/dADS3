\subsection{Red-Black Tree Implementation}
The c++ standard library contains a \textit{set} datatype as \texttt{std::set} which is implemented using a red-black tree so to ensure no errors in the implementation and to save some time, we decided to use that for our tests. This will also give the red-black tree a better chance at competing with our Van Emde Boas tree based search tree as we expect the standard library to be well optimized. We wrote a small class implementing Insert, Remove and Predecessor using a \texttt{std::set}. We also wrote a small class implementing the same, using either our Van Emde Boas tree or bitsmart Van Emde Boas tree as well as the \textt{min} function to handle the case when there is no predecessor for our query in the interleaved test.

\subsection{Experiment Details}
Setup was much like in the previous heap tests, though the test themselves differed slightly.

\subsubsection{Test Types}
Four types of tests was done, where $n$ is the number of operations:
\begin{description}
\item[TestInserts] Tests the running time of \textt{Insert} operations by measuring the time it takes to insert the $n$ elements $0$ to $n-1$.
\item[TestRemove] Tests the running time of \textt{Remove} operations by measuring the time it takes to remove the $n$ elemens $0$ to $n-1$.
\item[TestPredecessor] Tests the running time of \textt{Predecessor} operations by first filling the search tree with $\frac{n}{4}$ random~\footnote{because we use c++'s rand() with default seed, each test runs with the same input elements}, yet unique, elements and then calling the predecessor function on elements $0$ to $n-1$.
\item[TestInterleaved] Tests a somewhat closer to realistic scenario by first filling the search tree like in the TestPredecessor test and then $n$ times querying for the predecessor of a random element, removing it from the datastructure and inserting it again.
\end{description}

\subsection{Expectations}

In this second test we expect to see similar trends as in the first, with the Van Emde Boas trees being significantly faster than the Red-Black tree. In terms of memory, we expect the normal Van Emde Boas tree to use a very large chunk of memory, but hope that our bitsmart Van Emde Boas tree will use a constant \textit{small} amount of memory, hopefully less than the Red-Black tree at large data sizes.

\subsection{Results}

Much as we had expected, we see both our Van Emde Boas trees run faster than \texttt{std::set} on all test cases, and again we see the bitsmart Van Emde Boas tree being somewhat faster than its unoptimized variant.

In terms of memory, we see the same trend as in test 1. The Van Emde Boas trees use a constant significant chunk of memory, with the basic Van Emde Boas using about 8 times as much as the optimized version. Again we see the memory efficient variant of the Van Emde Boas tree outperform the reference data structure in terms of memory at about 2 million elements.
