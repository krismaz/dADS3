\section{Conclusion}

In working with this project, we have managed to explore the difficulty of implementing data structures in purely functional languages. 
We have looked at Haskell, and how to make this language in particular perform well, and worked with a very nice performance testing framework.
Finally, we have implemented several queue data structures for functional languages, and experimentally tested their performance, to show that they performed as expected.
